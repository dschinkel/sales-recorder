PLAN:
## PR.0.1 Refactor App.tsx to Functional Components

1. **Initialize Task**
   - Re-read GUIDELINES.MD AND PROJECT_SPEC.MD ✓
   - Move task to [IN PROGRESS] in `tasks.md` ✓

2. **Refactor Component Layer (TDD)**
   - **RED**: Verify existing test `shows a hello world greeting` in `__tests__/App.test.tsx` passes with current class implementation. ✓
   - **GREEN**: Convert `Header` class component to a functional component in `App.tsx`. ✓
   - **REFACTOR**: Rename `Header` to `Greeting` (more domain-oriented, avoids generic naming) and ensure it's a humble view. ✓

3. **Verification & Finalization**
   - Run all tests `yarn test` one last time.
   - Run linter `yarn lint`.
   - Update `tasks.md` to [COMPLETED].
   - Final cleanup commit and push.
