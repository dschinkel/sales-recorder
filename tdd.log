# TDD Log - Task F.1.0

OUTSIDE-IN FLOW:
React Component (App.tsx) -> Domain Constant (QUESTIONS)

PLAN:
1. Component layer (Humble View)
   - Goal: Scaffold the App component to render a list of questions using a FlatList.
   - Changes: App.tsx
   - Verification: Manual verification on the simulator after Step 2 goes GREEN.
   - Note: Non-TDD scaffold for the View.

2. Domain Layer (Questions List)
   RED:
   - Test name: lists all sales questions
   - Location: __tests__/App.test.ts (or a new domain test file)
   - Intent: Ensure the list of questions provided to the component matches the requirements in PROJECT_SPEC.md.

   GREEN:
   - Minimal implementation: Define a QUESTIONS constant in App.tsx (or a separate domain file) containing all required questions.
   - Files expected to change: App.tsx

   COMMIT:
   - Proposed message: feat: F.1.0: lists all sales questions

   REFACTOR:
   - Candidate refactors (only if needed): Extract questions to a domain folder if they grow.
   - Files expected to change: App.tsx, src/domain/questions.ts

   COMMIT (only if refactor happened):
   - Proposed message: feat: F.1.0: refactor: extracts questions to domain

3. Cleanup & Verification
   - Run all tests
   - Fix linting errors
   - Run the app on the simulator and verify the list is visible.
   COMMIT:
   - Proposed message: feat: F.1.0: cleanup: final verification
