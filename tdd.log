# TDD Log - Task F.1.1

OUTSIDE-IN FLOW:
UI Component (QuestionItem) -> State Management (App.tsx)

PLAN:

1. QuestionItem Enhancement (Humble View)
   - Goal: Add a TextInput to each question to allow user input.
   - Changes: App.tsx

2. State Management (Answering Questions)
   RED:
   - Test name: updates answer for a specific question
   - Location: __tests__/App.test.tsx
   - Intent: Verify that when text is entered into a question's input, the app's state reflects that answer.
   
   GREEN:
   - Minimal implementation: Add a useState object in App.tsx (e.g., answers) and a handleAnswerChange function. Pass these to QuestionItem.
   - Files expected to change: App.tsx
   
   COMMIT:
   - Proposed message: feat: F.1.1: allows answering questions

3. Refactor (Optional)
   - Candidate refactor: Extract QuestionItem to its own file.
   - COMMIT:
   - Proposed message: refactor: F.1.1: extracts QuestionItem component

4. Cleanup & Verification
   - Run all tests.
   - Fix linting.
   - COMMIT:
   - Proposed message: feat: F.1.1: cleanup: final verification for answering
