PLAN:

### Task F.1.0.0: Topic of conversation (TDD Workflow)

Based on our discussion, here is the detailed PLAN for task **F.1.0.0** (Topic of conversation), incorporating a full TDD workflow for both the UI component and the logic.

---

### **PLAN: F.1.0.0 - Topic of Conversation**

**Step 1: Create the UI Component (TopicInput) - TDD Layer 1 (Outside)**
We will define the UI that allows a user to input the topic of conversation.

*   1.1 [RED]: Write a UI test in TopicInput.test.tsx that expects a text input with a label "What was the topic of your conversation?" and a placeholder "Enter topic here".
*   1.2 [GREEN]: Create the TopicInput.tsx component with basic Text and TextInput to satisfy the test.
*   1.3 [REFACTOR]: Review the component for styling or structural improvements while keeping the test green.
*   1.4 [COMMIT]: feat: F.1.0.0: UI: creates basic TopicInput component

**Step 2: Connect the UI to a State Hook - TDD Layer 2 (Inside)**
We will now add the ability to manage the input state via a custom hook.

*   2.1 [RED]: Write a test in useTopic.test.ts for a custom hook useTopic. The test should expect a topic state and a setTopic function, with an initial state of an empty string.
*   2.2 [GREEN]: Create the useTopic.ts hook using useState.
*   2.3 [REFACTOR]: Look for any hook-level optimizations or cleanups.
*   2.4 [COMMIT]: feat: F.1.0.0: Hook: creates useTopic hook for state management

**Step 3: Integrate Hook with Component**
We will now connect the hook to the UI component.

*   3.1 [RED]: Update the TopicInput.test.tsx to verify that when the user types in the input, the value is updated. This will require providing the hook's state and setter as props to the component.
*   3.2 [GREEN]: Update TopicInput.tsx to accept topic and onTopicChange props and wire them to the TextInput. Update App.tsx to use the useTopic hook and pass the data into TopicInput.
*   3.3 [REFACTOR]: Perform a final cleanup of the integration and styling.
*   3.4 [COMMIT]: feat: F.1.0.0: UI: integrates useTopic hook with TopicInput component

---

**Step 4: Final Cleanup & Verification**
*   4.1: Mark task F.1.0.0 as COMPLETED in tasks.md.
*   4.2: Run all tests one last time to ensure no regressions.
*   4.3: Run the linter and fix any errors.
*   4.4: Start the app and verify the UI on the simulator.
*   4.5: Final cleanup commit and push.
